                    <b>INSPIRATION:</b> Throughout this CSS Typeface assignment, both Instagram and Pinterest, have been great sources of inspiration for me. I came across an Instagram account ran by a Designer named <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barrettrmdesign">Barrett Reid-Maroney</a> and the account showcased a series of typographic specimens. These specimens of type, that sparked my interest, contained juxtapositions of thin to thick strokes and varying organic forms. I really wanted to create something similar to them because I thought their forms were so elegant and modern.

                    <b>CHALLENGE:</b> I slowed down my pace in order to think about how I was going to approach this assignment. As my experience and skills with HTML and CSS were lacking and at a beginner's level, I should do something I'm more capable of doing at within the timeframe.

                <h2>SHAPING MY IDEAS</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>IDEA:</b> Organic forms posed as a tough challenge for me at my level of experience so I tried to think of ways to help me overcome it. My struggles reminded me of Kiindergarten activities such as cutting out shapes and collaging them. I decided that this route was the best way for me to create my typeface in a playful and colorful manner. This way, I can be intentionally messy!
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>REFINEMENT:</b> To further refine my idea, I sought inspiration from Pinterest. I turned towards very bold and colorful geometric typography at the beginning until I suddenly thought about the Suprematism Art Movement and its artworks. Arrangements of abstract shapes helps me create compositions that could futher help refine my idea of 'messy' Kindergarten art. I hoped that merging these two ideas together could result and provoke something familiar and, at the same time, interesting.

                    <b>ON MY WAY:</b> After refining the general concept that I wanted my typeface to surround, I went to work. I started with templates given to me by my professor, Peter Ha, and then coded what I learned from the prvious lectures. There were points in which I didn't know what or how I should do something, but I did some searching on the internet. Resources I used for coding shapes were from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/">CSS-Tricks</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_shapes.asp">W3Schools</a>.

                    <b>FINISHING TOUCHES:</b> I also played around with different colour schemes. At first I had an idea of using random colors throughout the typeface. I thought doing this would emulate the chaotic but bright energy of arts and crafts, as well as Kindergarten. However, the artworks in Suprematism Art Movement had a limited colour palette. I decided to keep things organized and orderly but also colourful by alternating colours of the rainbow across the alphabet. This would be the best of both worlds.
