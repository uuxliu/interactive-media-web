		Hello everyone, my name is Wendy Liu. I decided to use the Blob Mixer tool to create my self-portrait because I love the many different visual qualities and forms the blob can take. I hope to become as versatile as this tool later in my creative practice—whatever I may end up doing and wherever I may end up being.

	<p>
		The white coloured blob represents my efforts to be a blank canvas. I try to learn new things and reflect on them, in order to improve myself. It represents my tendency to show different sides of me depending on who I'm with or what environment I'm in. It also represents the hope or positivity I try to seek despite dark or sad times and thus, the black background. I didn't put a title because I'm a very shy and introverted person. I'm a homebody so I'm usually at home—unbothered or just doing my own thing.

		Sometimes my mood can change from being very easy-going/calm...

		The scan lines and glow from the blob represents digital devices and how they've affected me. Even before declaring my Graphic Design major at OCAD, my life has been predominantly in front of a screen. I feel quite awkward in person, so I find being or talking behind a screen is more comforting sometimes.
	</p>

	<p>
		For some reason, my friends always say that I work well under pressure or that I'm doing well but it's not really true. I may seem like I'm handling things fine or doing well on the surface, but I'm really just making mistakes and trying to figure myself out. This would be the represented in my blob's ever-changing irregularities in its texture and glitches.
