		<b>Why does <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com">Laurel Schwulst</a> advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</b>
	</p>


	<p>
		Laurel Schwulst has written 'My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?'' in a very poetic way. From her writing, she indicates that she advocates for individual websites because compared to social media, they are places that potentially facilitates a self feedback loop. This is when someone puts energy into something—in this case, a website—and in turn, this website will help form that individual's own identity.
	</p>

	<p>
		I agree with her thoughts because I think the world of social media is very pressuring. Rather than someone forming their true identities on a social media platform, I feel that it's more likely that the person is conforming to social standards and what society expects from people. Often times, social media is a place where people showcase 'perfect' or 'aesthetic' things from their life. In reality, they could be fabricating or hiding themselves and just showcasing the best parts but not the worst. There's no chance for self-growth to happen because no one is learning but rather hiding behind a generic mask, which blends in with many users from all over the world that are also on the platform. I believe that when you're using social media, you're in someone else's world; but when you're on your own individual website, you're actually creating and navigating in a world that belongs to you.

		<b>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</b>
