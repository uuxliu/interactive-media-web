		<b>1. What are some challenges you face when giving a critique?</b>
	</p>


	<p>
		Critiques are very eye-opening and can be sort of fun but personally, I tend to observe and listen rather than be part of the active conversation that happens. This poses to be my greatest challenge when I'm giving others a critique and perhaps part of the reason why is because I'm very shy, so I haven't mustered up the courage to have everyone stare at me and speak up about something just yet. The other part of the reason is because sometimes I question if what I think should even be said. I question myself whether or not, what I think can really help the person receiving it because I'm scared that it may be invalid or not credible. At the back of my head, I think about how I'm still learning myself so if I don't know too much about something, then maybe I shouldn't really say anything. Even though the pandemic has made courses online, I'm surprisingly more inclined and willing to give others critiques. However, another challenge I saw was figuring out how to type and word everything properly so that the person on the other side of the screen is able to understand what I'm trying to say or refer to. I also found that it was hard to give critiques because I wouldn't have much to say so my critiques ended up being very repetitive to me.

		<b>2. How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		When I disagree with a critique and I’m part of the group that is critiquing someone’s work, I simply acknowledge their point of view and kindly say, “I actually disagree because…”. I think this creates opportunities for an open dialogue that perhaps can help the individual understand how their work is being interpreted amongst different people and if they’ve reached their final intended goal for us, the audience. When I disagree with a critique and my work is the one that’s being critiqued, I simply thank them because I believe all perspectives are valuable and valid as they will help me to understand how people react to my work and in turn, helps me create a better final. However, as an artist I believe my stylistic choices shouldn’t be easily changed without any caution or thought. I would try to understand the differences, why they're occurring and troubleshoot for a better solution that best suits the end results that I aim to have.

		<b>3. Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques?</b>
	</b>

	<p>
		I think it’s both important to give and receive critiques because it helps to connect people in order for them to learn, improve and grow in their practice. The feedback or knowledge from others are valuable because they could greatly improve the workflow you have. It helps both parties gain an understanding of each other's styles, differences or similarities to help improve your ability to successfully create in a way that you want. When you give others critiques, it helps to improve your artistic or critical eye to view things objectively and strengthens one's vocabulary or language used in a particular field.
