		<b>1. Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</b>
	</p>


	<p>
		The two ideological camps, flat and skeuo, were really interesting reads that I never thought much about. I personally like looking at flat designs rather than skeumorphs on a screen because I think it’s a lot more consistent to the medium and much more appealing to look at. However, after reading ‘What Screens Want’, Frank Chimero makes a really good point when he says that screens aren’t tied to an aesthetic but are near-tangible, visible metaphors where movement, growth and evolution is repeatedly and progressively exhibited. Although I don’t think one is ‘better’ than the other, I do think humans also exhibit progressive change so it’s absolutely okay to switch or mix between the two to create what we need or have to achieve in the end. As creatives, I think we need a balance between the two: it’s foundational that we keep consistent with what we know and what looks good, just like flat design; but we should also be tangible and have the freedom to express in different ways, just like skeumorphs.

		<b>2. What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		The zoopraxiscope was invented by Eadweard Muybridge where he attempted to set time in motion by printing high-speed photographs radially on a glass disc and spinning it while it was lit from behind. This invention is a volume of travelling light that needs to land on something in order to show itself. As this invention is one of the origins of screens, it relates to web and interaction design because they're similar to animated GIFs and naturally exhibit looping imagery or animations.
	</p>

	<p>Another example from filmmaking that has inspired digital design is when filmmakers found a way to record films in colour instead of the black-and-white that the industry was used to. This newfound ability to implement colour allowed a clearer communicative transparencies for perspectives, emotions, and more to be shown through a digital screen.

		<b>3. Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not.</b>
	</b>

	<p>
		Instead of wanting 'flux', I think screens need flux because it's evident that we need it. As a species, we are constantly evolving and progressively learning every day; and more evidently, through each new generation. A machine, digital or not, is something that was created to function as a helping hand to make our lives easier or more convenient. The world and us, changes fast and as we gain new or efficient knowledge, machines need to be upgraded in order to keep up with us. Machines that we use or may use in the future, must be upgraded or programmed by us in a way that’s smarter and more efficient than us to be considered worthy or compatible for us to use. Otherwise, they wouldn’t serve us any purpose. That’s why in the case of ‘flux’, I think that it’s our knowledge which allows screens to need to have ‘flux’ instead of the screens themselves wanting ‘flux’.
