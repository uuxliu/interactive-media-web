	<p class="intro">READING RESPONSE 3: TOURING COMPLETE USER</p>

		<b>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</b>
	</p>


	<p>
		I think Lialina is very fascinated about the notion of interfaces and how it affects others. She describes how the developments of the disappearance of the computer and the invisibility of the word “user” is an evolutionary step; and references many reputable sources from history that always move away and advance from the term.  For example, the shift from 1995 to 2012 where UX designers avoided utilizing the “U” in UXD for papers and conference announcements. The efforts to highlight terms such as “people” and “natural”, align with wanting to liberate humans from being overshadowed by the digital world. This text suggests Lialina’s yearn for a more fair and free interaction amongst people who have contact with the internet, which includes open conversations to customization, security and application.

		<b>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Lialina’s ideal user is someone who is individualistic and values ambiguity. They have a universal user’s mindset, which results in an interaction that makes the user visible. She believes that users have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device and how these are the users who will find ways to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it. In other words, the presence of the user is part of an app or website’s workflow. An extreme example that she uses to illustrate these qualities she outlines is by using an anonymous projected called Google Maps + Google Video + Mashup—Claude Lelouche’s Rendezvous, where the user has to be aware and is suggestive of taking care of themselves so that they can complete a task at the right moment.

		<b>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</b>
	</b>

	<p>
		From my experience interacting on the web, I think there are both smaller and bigger gaps that can be filled by users when they’re able to personalize or customize something to their preference. It could be something as simple as being able to configure and add extensions to personalize one’s Google Chrome browser. Websites such as Format or Wixx, allow users to customize and create their own webpage to showcase work by method of templates. With this, users could evidently utilize the same template as someone else’s but have completely different looks. Another example of a truly customisable website is Tumblr—something that actually introduced me HTML and coding. With Tumblr, many users are able to completely and freely fill in the gaps as to how their blog could look like, whether they coded themselves or utilised codes others have posted online. I remember playing around with HTML codes on Tumblr to change the look of the layout of the blog by searching different themes online; the colors I used to create the overall look I wanted; adding a music player; having rain or snow effects; floating words around the curser; and much more—the possibilities were endless.
