		<b>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</b>
	</p>


	<p>
		When Seu asks the reader to join her to ‘defamiliarize our tools’, I think she means to ask us to explore past the assigned functions and abilities that’s associated with the technology we’re used to. By stepping away from a world we were taught and are familiar with, we can then be able to see, think and explore the same world in an innovative way to form new discoveries.
	</p>

	<p>
		I find that Seu’s philosophy is similar to that of Olia Lialina’s as both seem to advocate stepping back to relearn and make new discoveries. The most important point they stress is that while relearning, being mindful and thinking about what, how and why something is the way it was created. This facilities a healthy learning environment that cycles and improves our knowledge to reinvent every time. Doing these actions is like reading and deciphering poetry, where one has to be mindful to what the poem could mean. Literature is also open to translation and means something different to each individual. Similarly, we should find ways to expand, explore and understand the things we know for us to translate into new possibilities.

		<b>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</b>
	</p>

	<p>
		Of Seu’s 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics, Performing Data is something that I’m most interested in seeing. For me, numeric and mathematical information such as data is hard for me to understand. This category is suggestive of work that allows the user to defamiliarize and explore possibilities of how to visually refamiliarize ourselves with data, so that it’s more consumable for the user and easier to understand, even if the user speaks another language. Visually, Performing Data is poetic in the way that its meaning is suggestive from the way it’s represented to the user.

	<p>
		I believe <a class="link" href="https://boniver.withspotify.com">this website</a> operates within the chosen definition because the website seeks to showcase a visual representation of how the world is streaming Boniver’s album with an excessive use of the small letter i. With this website experience, the user can visualize how Boniver’s collective is expanding by use of incorporating interactions that are suggestive such as moving animations, regenerative abilities, and visualizers such as a globe.
